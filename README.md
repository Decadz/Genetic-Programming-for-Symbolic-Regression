# Genetic Programming with Rademacher Complexity for Symbolic Regression

## Abstract

Genetic Programming (GP) for symbolic regression
is often prone to overfitting the training data, causing poor
performance on unseen data. A number of recent works in the
field have been devoted to regulating this problem by investigating
both the structural and functional complexity of GP individuals
during the evolutionary process. This work uses the Rademacher
complexity and incorporates it into the fitness function of GP,
utilising it as a means of controlling the functional complexity
of GP individuals. The experiment results confirm that the new
GP method has a notable generalization gain compared to the
standard GP and Support Vector Regression (SVR) in most of the
considered problems. Further investigations also show that the
new GP method generates symbolic regression models that could
not only release the overfitting trend in standard GP but also
are significantly smaller in size compared to their counterparts
in standard GP.
